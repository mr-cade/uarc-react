         <h3>December 10 (on-line)meeting: DX From the Early Days</h3>
         <p>Ron Wilcox, KF7ZN, will be presenting our December program on DX and how it has been a part of amateur radio almost since the very beginning of the hobby’s existence. (DX is a shortcut for “distance” and for HF operation currently means working foreign countries. At other times, shorter distances were difficult and might have qualified as “DX.”)</p>
         <p>Ron is a DXer himself and is a member of the Board of Directors for the Utah DX Association. He writes:</p>
         <p>This presentation is a fun and non-technical look back at the beginnings of ham radio and how DXing was a part of that. We will start in the late 1800’s, and end in the 1960’s. We will touch on the influence of the military, government, clubs, etc., including the friendly but strong competition between England and the U.S. for the first transatlantic contact. Five important figures in this history are highlighted. Much of this is from a humorous and personal perspective of the individuals involved.</p>
         <p>Ron tells us that he is a “California boy” having grown up in Solvang and Hollister, leaving the state when he graduated from San Benito High School. He has degrees from Boise State University, Weber State University, and BYU-Idaho.</p>
         <p>He currently lives in Clinton and is a particular fan of Elecraft products. He is active as an instructor and examiner. He is currently a Nurse Case Manager with Intermountain Healthcare/Select Health (RN BSN). Check his QRZ listing for further details.</p>
         <p>The meeting will be on Thursday, December 10, and will, again, be an on-line meeting. It can be accessed (along with several past meeting programs) by going to: https://www.youtube.com/c/UtahAmateurRadioClub.</p>
         <p>The meeting will start at the usual 7:30 P.M. It should be possible to connect to it and make sure everything is working any time after 7:00.</p>
         <p>Except for July and August, UARC meetings are held on the second Thursday of each month at 7:30 P.M.</p>
